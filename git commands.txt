#To initialise git repo
git init

#To add new file in git
git add index.html
#Adding multiple files
git add index.html index2.html 

#To check status
git status

#Files are now staged but you'll have to do the commits
git commit -m "Add msg here to for this commit"

#Suppose now you have done more than one commit you can check history using log & you'll get ids for each commits
git log

#You'll get history of commits and you can temporary resume to older commits using id
git checkout <id>
#In this case you temporary goes back to older commit detached from your branch n if you want to go back to branch
git checkout main

#If you wish to revert commits you can use, that will revert that particular commit and add a message
git revert <id>

#Now we have understood how to delete older commits using git revert 
#Suppose you want to delte old commits and go back to previous stage by not ding reverts
#Undo changes by deleting all commits since <id>
git reset --hard <id>
